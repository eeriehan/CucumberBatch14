Class 1 -

BDD -   behavioral driven development

          Given
                When
                    And
                        Then

We use BDD scenarios -  to five a clear understanding to other colleagues in the team

To write the BDD scenarios in cucumber  -   we use special type of file

            -   it allows us to write scenarios in gherkin languge

        Feature -   User story

        Scenario    -   Test case - every test case will be considered as scenario in BDD

                    -   Given   -   Pre-requisite/pre-condition
                        When    -   perform actions
                        Then    -   Expected output
                        And     -   Supporting tag

    Step definition -   Cucumber provides the snippets of step definition
                        in step definition, we write the code to perform actions which has been written
                        in the BDD statement.

                        To execute all the feature files from one class, we need runner class
